**Describe the bug**
There are stylistic formatting errors with the following print statements:
“your full retirement are is   66  and  0  months”
The word “your” should start with a capital letter.
The spacing in-between “is  66  and  0  months” should be uniform and standard with common English language rules.

“this will be in  January  of  2009”
The word “this” should start with a capital letter.
The spacing in-between “in  January  of  2009” should be uniform and standard with common English language rules.
